Link: https://models-collection.netlify.app/

Based on Minifig Collection "tool" with new features:
- choose number of columns
- two lists: collection and wishlist
- sorting collection and wishlist by name, year, id
- searching collection and wishlist by name
- collection displays number of models and sum of all parts
- searching models by name, id of theme, year
- "only LS" mode: means Lego System and for me it is more "classic" models. Mode allows you filter out technic, fabuland and super-bat-aven-something themes
- searching themes by name
- random model (includes whole database)
- "onclick" displaing enlarged image
