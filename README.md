# Models Collection

Link: https://models-collection.netlify.app/

## This app will provide fun for children and their parents! If you had models of Lego Company you can rebuild your collection from the past - show your children old sets and additionally teach them many new English words.

Based on [Minifig Collection](https://github.com/Pdzoc/Minifigs-Collection) "tool" (browsing Rebrickable database - this time models) with new features:
- choose the number of columns
- two lists: collection and wishlist
- sorting collection and wishlist by name, year, id
- searching collection and wishlist by name
- collection displays the number of models and the sum of all parts
- searching models by name, id of theme, year
- "only LS" mode: means Lego System and for me, it is more "classic" models. Mode allows you to filter out technic, fabuland and super-bat-aven-something themes
- searching themes by name
- random model (includes whole database)
- "onclick" displaying enlarged image
